# Awesome Project

This is a very cool project, what offer the user list of very interesting offers to choose from.

## Project Structure

### AwesomeProject

This project uses [React Clean Architecture](https://dev.to/kpiteng/react-clean-architecture-114f) from the structure side and from the technical side we used [redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [redux saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/) for the state management, and for the navigation we used [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/).

### back

This folder contains a mock backend that serves the data needed to complete the technical challenge. This server is built using [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server). To run this server, use the command `yarn serve`.
Refer to the [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) documentation on how to query data from the APIs.
